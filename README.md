# QR Code Generator

This project generates QR codes with a branded logo on it



## Future Improvements
Scan tracking (logging device info, time, and location) could be added in the future by integrating with a web server or analytics service. Currently, this project only generates static QR codes.



## How to Use
1. Run `qr_generator_improved.py` to generate QR codes.

## Files
- `qr_generator_improved.py`: Main QR code generator script.
- `logo_for_qr.png`, `logo_ico.ico`, `logo.jpeg`: Logo files for QR branding.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.


## Note
Scan tracking is not currently supported in this project.
